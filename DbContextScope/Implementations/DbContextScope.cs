           * 
           * Since the CallContext flows through all async points, the ambient scope in the 
           * main flow of execution ended up becoming the ambient scope in this parallel flow
           * of execution as well. So when we were created, we captured it as our "parent scope".

           * The main flow of execution then completed while our flow was still ongoing. When 
           * the main flow of execution completed, the ambient scope there (which we think is our 
           * parent scope) got disposed of as it should.
           * 
           * So here we are: our parent scope isn't actually our parent scope. It was the ambient
           * scope in the main flow of execution from which we branched off. We should never have seen 
           * it. Whoever wrote the code that created this parallel task should have suppressed
           * the ambient context before creating the task - that way we wouldn't have captured
           * this bogus parent scope.
           * 
           * While this is definitely a programming error, it's not worth throwing here. We can only 
           * be in one of two scenario:
           * 
           * - If the developer who created the parallel task was mindful to force the creation of 
           * a new scope in the parallel task (with IDbContextScopeFactory.CreateNew() instead of 
           * JoinOrCreate()) then no harm has been done. We haven't tried to access the same DbContext
           * instance from multiple threads.
           * 
           * - If this was not the case, they probably already got an exception complaining about the same
           * DbContext or ObjectContext being accessed from multiple threads simultaneously (or a related
           * error like multiple active result sets on a DataReader, which is caused by attempting to execute
           * several queries in parallel on the same DbContext instance). So the code has already blow up.
           * 
           * So just record a warning here. Hopefully someone will see it and will fix the code.

This means that someone started a parallel flow of execution (e.g. created a TPL task, created a thread or enqueued a work item on the ThreadPool) within the context of a DbContextScope without suppressing the ambient context first. 

In order to fix this:
1) Look at the stack trace below - this is the stack trace of the parallel task in question.
2) Find out where this parallel task was created.
3) Change the code so that the ambient context is suppressed before the parallel task is created. You can do this with IDbContextScopeFactory.SuppressAmbientContext() (wrap the parallel task creation code block in this).
