       * This is where all the magic happens. And there is not much of it.
       * 
       * This implementation is inspired by the source code of the
       * TransactionScope class in .NET 4.5.1 (the TransactionScope class
       * is prior versions of the .NET Fx didn't have support for async
       * operations).
       * 
       * In order to understand this, you'll need to be familiar with the
       * concept of async points. You'll also need to be familiar with the
       * ExecutionContext and CallContext and understand how and why they 
       * flow through async points. Stephen Toub has written an
       * excellent blog post about this - it's a highly recommended read:
       * http://blogs.msdn.com/b/pfxteam/archive/2012/06/15/executioncontext-vs-synchronizationcontext.aspx
       * 
       * Overview: 
       * 
       * We want our DbContextScope instances to be ambient within 
       * the context of a logical flow of execution. This flow may be 
       * synchronous or it may be asynchronous.
       * 
       * If we only wanted to support the synchronous flow scenario, 
       * we could just store our DbContextScope instances in a ThreadStatic 
       * variable. That's the "traditional" (i.e. pre-async) way of implementing
       * an ambient context in .NET. You can see an example implementation of 
       * a TheadStatic-based ambient DbContext here: http://coding.abel.nu/2012/10/make-the-dbcontext-ambient-with-unitofworkscope/ 
       * 
       * But that would be hugely limiting as it would prevent us from being
       * able to use the new async features added to Entity Framework
       * in EF6 and .NET 4.5.
       * 
       * So we need a storage place for our DbContextScope instances 
       * that can flow through async points so that the ambient context is still 
       * available after an await (or any other async point). And this is exactly 
       * what CallContext is for.
       * 
       * There are however two issues with storing our DbContextScope instances 
       * in the CallContext:
       * 
       * 1) Items stored in the CallContext should be serializable. That's because
       * the CallContext flows not just through async points but also through app domain 
       * boundaries. I.e. if you make a remoting call into another app domain, the
       * CallContext will flow through this call (which will require all the values it
       * stores to get serialized) and get restored in the other app domain.
       * 
       * In our case, our DbContextScope instances aren't serializable. And in any case,
       * we most definitely don't want them to be flown accross app domains. So we'll
       * use the trick used by the TransactionScope class to work around this issue.
       * Instead of storing our DbContextScope instances themselves in the CallContext,
       * we'll just generate a unique key for each instance and only store that key in 
       * the CallContext. We'll then store the actual DbContextScope instances in a static
       * Dictionary against their key. 
       * 
       * That way, if an app domain boundary is crossed, the keys will be flown accross
       * but not the DbContextScope instances since a static variable is stored at the 
       * app domain level. The code executing in the other app domain won't see the ambient
       * DbContextScope created in the first app domain and will therefore be able to create
       * their own ambient DbContextScope if necessary.
       * 
       * 2) The CallContext is flow through *all* async points. This means that if someone
       * decides to create multiple threads within the scope of a DbContextScope, our ambient scope
       * will flow through all the threads. Which means that all the threads will see that single 
       * DbContextScope instance as being their ambient DbContext. So clients need to be 
       * careful to always suppress the ambient context before kicking off a parallel operation
       * to avoid our DbContext instances from being accessed from multiple threads.
       *
